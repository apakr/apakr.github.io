# Who am I
I am an undergrad at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Statistics and minoring in Computer Science.

Since I was old enough to work I've occupied my time with either some form of employment, intensive school work, or both. 

And excuse the extreme "LinkedIn Speak", but my goal is to have a career in a high data-oriented field, such as quantitative finance or machine learning. I love being part of a strong team and finding nuanced solutions to unusual problems.

# Why do you care
Well you're reading this now so clearly whatever efforts I made to get my name in front of you worked. 

I am addicted to figuring things out, whether thatâ€™s people, systems, or how to make things work better. If I'm convinced something is important, I find a way to make it work.

If you're looking for someone motivated who can cut through the noise and actually solve problems, that's what I do.

# Other interests
I am an avid book reader. I've finished nearly the entire Dostoevsky anthology. I'm also a big fan of Hemingway - _The Old Man and The Sea_ is my favorite "book" (novella).

I also really like music and listen to it all the time. For 2024 I had a combined 56,000 minutes listened across just Spotify and Soundcloud. How much did you listen?

Over the past year I've been getting into golf, I'm still pretty bad but I'm having a lot of fun. I also played club water polo for a while, and still get games together when our old team is in town.
